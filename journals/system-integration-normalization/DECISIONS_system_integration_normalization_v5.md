# DECISION LOG — system_integration_normalization

Status note: this v5 file supersedes the earlier v4 intake-specific snapshot as the current autonomous-governance SI/N decision addendum.

## Decision Entries

### DEC-system_integration_normalization-13
- Status: locked
- Decision: issue routing uses one central project plus label-based routing instead of one project per component or assignee-based agent routing.
- Date context: governance routing phase
- Why this was chosen: reduces owner admin overhead while staying automatable.
- What it affects: issue routing, project usage, and agent-lane classification.
- What it explicitly does NOT affect: optional human assignees for human ownership.
- Follow-up needed: keep project views aligned with the label taxonomy.

### DEC-system_integration_normalization-14
- Status: locked
- Decision: autonomous execution must minimize recurring owner administration and operate from repo truth.
- Date context: autonomy layer definition phase
- Why this was chosen: the owner should mainly take decisions, not perform repetitive system administration.
- What it affects: workflow design, escalation behavior, and governance reporting.
- What it explicitly does NOT affect: the owner's approval role on protected-main merges.
- Follow-up needed: prefer automation over manual bookkeeping when safe.

### DEC-system_integration_normalization-15
- Status: locked
- Decision: cross-component and system-wide impact must escalate automatically to system integration and governance.
- Date context: autonomy layer definition phase
- Why this was chosen: decisions that affect multiple lanes must not remain trapped in one chat or one component lane.
- What it affects: issue routing, escalation workflows, and SI issue creation.
- What it explicitly does NOT affect: component-local work with no cross-component effect.
- Follow-up needed: keep escalation logic aligned with impact labels and governance docs.

### DEC-system_integration_normalization-16
- Status: locked
- Decision: autonomous delivery must be support-matrix based and conservative.
- Date context: autonomy layer definition phase
- Why this was chosen: only components with normalized deploy and rollback contracts should auto-deliver.
- What it affects: autonomous delivery behavior.
- What it explicitly does NOT affect: future expansion of delivery support to more components once normalized.
- Follow-up needed: update the delivery matrix when additional components become support-ready.

### DEC-system_integration_normalization-17
- Status: locked
- Decision: UI/UX design standard and asset-placement work are first-class repo demands and must route through the same governance issue model as code or deployment work.
- Date context: autonomy layer definition phase
- Why this was chosen: non-code product work still affects the appliance and must not bypass repo governance.
- What it affects: chat intake handling, issue routing, and UX-related escalation.
- What it explicitly does NOT affect: whether the work is implemented by a code lane or a UX lane.
- Follow-up needed: keep UX and asset work mapped into the issue-routing model.

## Superseded Decisions
- The earlier v4 decision addendum remains historical; this v5 file is the current autonomy-layer addendum.
